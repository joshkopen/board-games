# board-games
For fun project using object oriented architecture to make different games using same components. The games all include a visual application which I created just enough to make the games playable, but the main focus of this project was practice with abstraction in Object Oriented Programming (and to have fun). 

## Currently Available Games
* TicTacToe
* Connect4
* Chess(Work In Progress)

### Have any ideas for a 2 dimensional board game which could be created? Submit it in issues!
